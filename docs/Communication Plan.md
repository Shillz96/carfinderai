# Communication Plan

## 1. Primary Communication Channel
*   **This Chat Interface:** Will be the primary method for day-to-day communication, quick questions, clarifications, code snippets, and agile feedback.

## 2. Milestone Updates
*   I will provide explicit updates upon the completion of each **Phase** outlined in the `Development Plan & Timeline.md`.
*   Updates will also be provided upon completion of significant sub-tasks or achievement of key functionalities within a phase (e.g., "Craigslist scraper now successfully saving leads to Google Sheets").

## 3. Reporting & Check-ins
*   **End-of-Day Summaries (Optional/As Needed):** If helpful, I can provide brief summaries of tasks completed, progress made, and any immediate blockers at the end of a development session, especially during active coding phases.
Please let me know if this is desired.
*   **Weekly Summary (if project extends beyond a week per phase):** A brief recap of the week's progress, next steps, and any revised timeline estimates if significant deviations occur.

## 4. Questions and Feedback from Client
*   You are encouraged to ask questions, provide feedback, or request clarifications at **any point** via this chat interface.
*   Prompt feedback is appreciated, especially on UI elements or workflow decisions when presented.

## 5. Demonstrations
*   I can provide demonstrations of working components as they become ready and testable (e.g., showing the web interface displaying test leads, demonstrating a successful scrape and notification).
*   Demonstrations can be done via descriptions, screenshots, or screencasts if appropriate and supported.

## 6. Documentation Updates
*   Key project documents (`Project Specification.md`, `Technical Design Document.md`, etc.) will be kept updated as the project evolves. Significant changes will be highlighted.

## 7. Issue Reporting
*   If you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior once components are delivered for UAT, please report them through this chat, providing as much detail as possible (e.g., steps to reproduce, screenshots, error messages).

## 8. Availability
*   I will do my best to respond promptly during typical working hours. Please allow for reasonable response times, especially for complex queries that may require some investigation or coding effort before a full answer can be provided.
