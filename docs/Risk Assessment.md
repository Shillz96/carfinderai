# Risk Assessment

This document identifies potential risks, their assessment, and mitigation strategies for the Used Car Lead Generation Agent project.

## Risk Register

### 1. Technical Risks

*   **Risk ID:** T001
    *   **Risk:** Changes in Target Website Structure (Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace)
    *   **Description:** Target websites frequently update their HTML structure or employ anti-scraping measures, which can break the scraping modules.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Especially for Facebook Marketplace)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Scraper for the affected site will stop collecting new leads or collect inaccurate data until fixed).
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Design scrapers to be highly modular, separating parsing logic from fetching logic.
        *   Use robust selectors (e.g., less reliant on exact CSS classes, more on stable attributes or structure if possible).
        *   Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to detect breakages quickly (e.g., alerts if no new leads are found for X consecutive runs, or if parsing error rates spike).
        *   Regularly monitor target websites (manual checks or automated smoke tests if feasible).
        *   Maintain a version history of scraper configurations/selectors that previously worked.
        *   Allocate development time for ongoing maintenance and scraper updates post-deployment.
    *   **Contingency Plan:** If a scraper breaks, prioritize its fix. Temporarily disable the affected scraper to prevent system errors if it impacts other modules. Notify client of the outage.

*   **Risk ID:** T002
    *   **Risk:** IP Address Rate Limiting or Blocking
    *   **Description:** Aggressive scraping can lead to the agent's IP address being blocked by target websites.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Scraper will be unable to collect any data from the blocking site).
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement polite scraping practices: Adhere to `robots.txt` (if they exist and are relevant for the specific parts being scraped).
        *   Introduce randomized delays between requests (`time.sleep()` with random intervals).
        *   Rotate User-Agent strings to mimic different browsers.
        *   Monitor HTTP response codes for signs of blocking (e.g., 403, 429).
        *   Consider using a proxy rotation service as a last resort if blocking is persistent and other methods fail (adds cost and complexity).
    *   **Contingency Plan:** If IP is blocked, stop scraping from that source immediately. Investigate using proxies or reduce scraping frequency significantly. May require manual intervention to get unblocked or switch IPs.

*   **Risk ID:** T003
    *   **Risk:** Inconsistent or Unstructured Data Format on Listings
    *   **Description:** Car listings, especially on Facebook Marketplace or from private sellers on Craigslist, may have inconsistent formatting for year, make, model, price, or contact details, making automated extraction difficult and error-prone.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Leads to inaccurate or incomplete data, potentially missed leads if critical info like year can't be parsed).
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Develop flexible parsing logic using regular expressions and multiple fallback patterns for key data points.
        *   Implement data validation routines to check data types and ranges (e.g., year is a 4-digit number, price is numeric).
        *   Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., basic named entity recognition for make/model) if simple regex is insufficient (adds complexity).
        *   Log listings with parsing difficulties for manual review and parser improvement.
        *   Prioritize extracting essential fields (year, contact info, listing URL) even if other fields are problematic.

*   **Risk ID:** T004
    *   **Risk:** Thryv API Issues or Limitations
    *   **Description:** The Thryv API might be unreliable, have undocumented limitations, change without notice, or be difficult to integrate with.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on Thryv API quality)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Leads may not be automatically transferred to Thryv, requiring manual entry or delays).
    *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review Thryv API documentation before and during integration.
        *   Implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms (with exponential backoff) for API calls.
        *   Log all API requests and responses for debugging.
        *   Monitor Thryv API status page (if available).
        *   Have a well-tested fallback plan (e.g., Zapier integration from Google Sheets, or clear instructions for manual data export/import).
    *   **Contingency Plan:** If Thryv API is down or integration fails persistently, switch to Zapier or manual export/import process and notify the client.

*   **Risk ID:** T005
    *   **Risk:** Facebook Marketplace Scraping Complexity
    *   **Description:** Facebook Marketplace is notoriously difficult to scrape due to dynamic content, reliance on JavaScript, login requirements, and frequent A/B testing of its interface.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High (May significantly delay or even prevent effective scraping from this source, impacting lead volume).
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Allocate significant development and testing time for this scraper.
        *   Be prepared to use browser automation tools like Selenium (adds resource overhead and complexity).
        *   Investigate if there are any (unofficial) APIs or alternative ways to access FB Marketplace data, though unlikely to be reliable or permitted.
        *   Start with a very specific target (e.g., one group, simple search) and expand incrementally.
        *   Focus on extracting the most critical data points reliably.
    *   **Contingency Plan:** If FB Marketplace scraping proves infeasible within a reasonable timeframe or becomes unreliable, discuss with the client about focusing solely on Craigslist or exploring other potential lead sources. This might require a scope adjustment.

*   **Risk ID:** T006
    *   **Risk:** External Service Downtime (Twilio, Google Sheets, Email Provider)
    *   **Description:** Relies on external APIs which can experience downtime.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (for major providers like Google/Twilio)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Temporary inability to send SMS/emails or store data).
    *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement retry mechanisms for API calls.
        *   Queue tasks locally if an external service is temporarily unavailable (e.g., save leads locally and upload to Sheets later).
        *   Have fallbacks where critical (though less so for these specific services given their general reliability).
        *   Monitor service status pages.

### 2. Project Risks

*   **Risk ID:** P001
    *   **Risk:** Underestimation of Development Time/Effort
    *   **Description:** The complexity of certain tasks (especially Facebook scraping or Thryv integration) might be underestimated.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Project timeline may be extended, potentially impacting client expectations).
    *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Break down tasks into smaller, manageable units (as done in the `Development Plan`).
        *   Build in contingency time in the schedule.
        *   Prioritize core functionality first.
        *   Communicate regularly with the client about progress and any potential delays.
        *   Re-evaluate and adjust timeline if significant unforeseen complexities arise.

*   **Risk ID:** P002
    *   **Risk:** Changes in Client Requirements
    *   **Description:** Client may request changes or additions to the scope during development.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Low to Medium (Depending on the nature and scale of changes, could impact timeline and effort).
    *   **Severity:** Low to Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure initial requirements in `Project Specification.md` are clear and agreed upon.
        *   Have a process for evaluating change requests: assess impact on timeline, effort, and cost.
        *   Document all approved changes.
        *   For significant changes, discuss potential trade-offs (e.g., de-scoping another feature or extending timeline).

### 3. Data Risks

*   **Risk ID:** D001
    *   **Risk:** Extraction of Incorrect or Sensitive Seller Information
    *   **Description:** Scraper might incorrectly parse phone numbers or inadvertently pick up other PII not intended for the initial outreach.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Could lead to sending messages to wrong numbers or privacy concerns).
    *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation rules for phone numbers.
        *   Carefully define the scope of data to be extracted.
        *   Thoroughly test scraper output for accuracy of contact information.
        *   Client to review the standard SMS message to ensure it's appropriate.

This risk register will be reviewed periodically and updated as new risks emerge or existing ones change.
